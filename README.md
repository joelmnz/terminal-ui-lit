# app1

A web application built with Lit and TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (JavaScript runtime and package manager)

## Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd app1
bun install
```

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This will start a local development server at http://localhost:5173 with hot module replacement.

## Building for Production

```bash
bun run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
bun run preview
```
